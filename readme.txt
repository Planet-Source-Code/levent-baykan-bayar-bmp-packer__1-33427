BMP PACKER
=========================
So far what we have done?,BMP Packer compiles a bunch of bmp files into one file (Both 8 bits & 24 bits),and reads them to display images from there.There is no extracting so your files are 100 % safe with this code.Your bmp's are read once at start up and you can access them anytime you like at run time.Demo project is heavily commented,It's very easy to understand and adapt it into your project.


FILES
=========================
packbmp   VB6 project files
readme.txt :This file
levent.bpk :Sample file

FAQ
=========================
1)What does this code do? 
Assume that you've made a game with bmp's and you want your images to be inaccessable by user.It's the time where BMP Packer begins...

2)Why did you do this?
I am currently working on an Adventure/RPG,this will serve as a image format for that game.

3)What can I do to improve it?
You may add a direct memory access to draw bmps to dcs faster.There is a commented code block inside the project for this but I can't make it work.The code for Memory access belongs to Stephan Kirchmaier. The original file can be found at http://www.vb-empire.de.vu/.

4)What is the drawback?
Speed.

5)What's next?
Compiling multiple wav's into one file.
